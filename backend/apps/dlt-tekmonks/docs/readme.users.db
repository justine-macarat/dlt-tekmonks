This is a SQLite3 DB based user login DB.

Each registered user is given a hashed (double hashed) ID under the 
"db/users" table and their data is stored there within.

Schema
sqlite> .schema users
CREATE TABLE users(id varchar, name varchar);

Also the file "db/webscrolls.db" contains the USER IDs of all registered 
users as a simple string array. 

The Login API relies on this structure.
