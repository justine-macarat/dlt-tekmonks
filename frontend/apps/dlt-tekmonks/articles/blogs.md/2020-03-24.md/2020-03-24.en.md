#Healthcare Targeted in Cyberattacks

#####By Abby Rose - March 24, 2020

##Healthcare Attacks
Even in the event of a pandemic, cyber-attacks have hit U.S. healthcare facilities. Only a few days ago the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s (HHS) computer networks were attacked. John Ullyot made this statement on behalf of the National Security Council about the incident, “We are aware of a cyber incident related to the Health and Human Services computer networks, and the federal government is investigating this incident thoroughly.” The networks are now working normally, but not without disruption in a time of crisis. The attack was conducted by overloading the HHS servers with millions of hits over several hours. There have been other healthcare attacks and serious ransomware attacks as well. One of the newest ransomwares called NetWalker, inputs malicious code into Windows Explorer, hoping to hide from detection. However some hackers have agreed to keep peace with healthcare during this pandemic.
