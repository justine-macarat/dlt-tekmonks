  "description": "LoginCat is an AI-based encryption software, designed to keep everything an organization, contractor, government, bank, or healthcare provider needs protected and secure. A primary aspect of LoginCat is assigning users a "trust score," using AI, organizational metrics, and roles that can be customized to the needs of your organization. If the individual trying to access the network does not meet the minimum trust score, they are denied access. It is not a product that is restricted to on-premises systems. LoginCat is also compatible with cloud-based systems.LoginCat uses patented passphrase technology rather than a normal password system to protect your business' information. It makes it so that even methods like rainbow tables have a hard time breaking into your network. The software can be programmed to have users change their passcodes as frequently as every week or up to every 90 days to further increase the network's security.LoginCat also has SSO integrations. It comes with its own MFAcompliant, high-security login portal, so that it can be implemented into an institution's login page. LoginCat also offers biometric support so passwords are unnecessary. It allows the use of fingerprint scans, facial ID, and much more to be used as second-factor authentication. You can also integrate the software into existing login pages to bolster your business' existing security measures. LoginCat also integrates with all known Windows and Linux servers as well as all web and mobile applications and VPNs. LoginCat is the only software that supports thick client SSOs like Oracle Forms. The best part about LoginCat is that you don't have to change anything about your applications. It integrates itself with the application and makes it MFA compliant if it was not already.If you want a product that counters cyber-attacks at no extra cost or risk, LoginCat is the product for you.
