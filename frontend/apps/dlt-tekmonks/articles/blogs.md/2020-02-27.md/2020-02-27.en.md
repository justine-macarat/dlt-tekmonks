#Combat Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Created by Coronavirus

##How Does the Coronavirus Effect Cybersecurity? 
During this threat of the Coronavirus, ample opportunities for people to take advantage of cyber vulnerabilities have become available and exploited. One cyberthreat is the phishing emails that are viruses disguised as medical information emails regarding the Coronavirus. Another cyberthreat exploited the movement for employers to telecommute, working from home, and working on vulnerable networks. TekMonks has compiled some helpful tips to combat these issues. 

##Coronavirus Phishing Email Threat Tips
Because phishing emails are a threat that individuals and companies deal with daily, if there is a system already in place to block phishing emails, this should not be an issue. Vice President of TekMonks, Rohit Kapoor assures, “Smart firewall systems will disable all phishing… so if the user clicks them, nothing happens.” There are other ways to combat the emails such as blocking the specific email address of the emails in your settings, WHO does not send email from addresses ending in ‘@who.com’ , ‘@who.org’ or ‘@who-safety.org’ for example. If there is a legitimate email from WHO it will end in ‘@who.int’ if there is any other extension after the ‘@’ symbol, it is not from WHO and is a phishing email. However, for something as common as phishing emails, your company should have protection such as a smart firewall. When asked about the best prevention, Kapoor said, “This is the best secondary protection possible.” 

And when the link is clicked it does redirect to a fake page that consists of the official, current home page of the World Health Organization (WHO), with the addition of a popup form asking for login information. The background is the exact home page for WHO which makes it an easy mistake to automatically react by giving a possible login. In an age of the internet where every website and app requests a login and bad memories lead to the reuse of a common password and email combo, this is the perfect trap for muscle memory. 

When the link is clicked it does redirect to a fake page that consists of the official, current home page of the World Health Organization (WHO) , with the addition of a popup form asking for login information.
After the information is stolen, the site will reload and redirect to the actual WHO site, making it nearly impossible to detect information has been stolen. If this has already happened, the best measure to take is to reset the password for important sites that use the same login information.  

##Coronavirus Prevention Method of Telecommuters Threat Tips
The Coronavirus is causing companies in affected countries to take precautionary measures in order to reduce the spread. One of these measures is to keep people from coming to work by encouraging, and sometimes requiring, telecommuting only. This means a lot of private company information being accessed on low security networks. These companies need to have some cybersecurity safety measures in place. In addition, many companies are not set up to allow access to office desktops and systems easily and need to figure out what steps to take to make this a possibility. One of the products TekMonks produces, LoginCat RAS, is specifically made to combat this issue.
