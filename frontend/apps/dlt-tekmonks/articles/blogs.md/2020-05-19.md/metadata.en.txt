  "description": "As the workforce turns digital, I find myself wondering whether this was inevitable. Before COVID-19, our economy was being driven by the forth revolution, or the technology revolution. However, between 2005 and 2015, the percentage of people regularly working remotely only increased from 2% to 3%.
