#The Impact of The Iranian Crisis on Cybersecurity

#####By Abby Rose - February 18, 2020

##The Death of Qassim Suleimani
On 3 January 2020, a U.S. drone strike was carried out near Baghdad airport that targeted and killed Maj. Gen Qassim Suleimani. Suleimani was the commander of Iran’s Quds Forces who have been labeled by the U.S. as a terrorist organization responsible for dozens of attacks in the Middle East against the American Embassy, among others. The State Department stated that the strike was, “in response to imminent threats to American lives.” 

##Threat of Retaliation
The death of Suleimani has created unrest in Iran leading to conversations about retaliation. Suleimani was one of Iran’s most powerful military commanders who oversaw security and intelligence along with being a close confidant for the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Iranian military’s three leading players in cyber operations are the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Basji, and Iran’s NPDO. The IRGC and Basji are the offensive operations while NPDO is the passive defense organization that protect infrastructure. Suleimani ran the IRGC Quds Force which deals with foreign operations. The impact of his death as a high-ranking leader has led to one of the most significant U.S.-Iran escalations in relations in the last 40 years. Khamenei has called for “forceful revenge” for the death of Suleimani. In an interview with BBC, Foreign Minister Zarif stated, “The U.S. killed officials. That is an act of war…the action by the United States has consequences that will happen. And I believe that has already happened.” Since the death of Suleimani, the U.S. government seems to believe that the retaliations will be in the form of a cyber-attack and have released several formal advisories. These reports were released by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Financial Services (DFS), to name a few. 

##What Have Iranian Cyber Attacks Look Like in The Past?
Iran has already carried out a variety of cyber-attacks against the U.S., Israel, and others. The areas that have been targeted in the past have been U.S. Federal, State and Local Government facilities, critical infrastructure, and foreign allies. Iran historically attacks both public and private sector information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) networks for information collection of sensitive intelligence. Iran has also targeted the U.S. financial sectors. The tactics used in the attacks include Wiperware, Ransomware, DDoS, Supply Chain, and OT.

###Wiperware

Used in to attack computer systems of Saudi Armco in 2012. The Wiperware compromised the machine and allowed Shamoon malware to spread to other devices across the network. This attack overwrote data on 30,000 computers. 

###Ransomware

The Iranian perpetrators of the largest ransomware attack by Iran were indicted in 2018. The attack was carried out by 2 Iranian over a 34-month period. During that period, their sophisticated ransomware encryption campaign titled, “SamSam Ransomware,” attacked more that 200 State and Local Government computers, public institutions, healthcare clinics, hospitals, and universities. The Ransomware demanded payment in cryptocurrency and affected Georgia, New Jersey, and California.   

###DDoS

The 7 Iranian perpetrators for the DDoS attacks, who were employed by companies working with the Iranian government and the IRGC, were indicted in 2016. The attack was a 176-day campaign against 46 systems that were mostly within the U.S. financial sector. The attacks occurred between 2011 and 2013 and prevented access to banking services and customer accounts. This DDoS attack costed the companies “tens of millions of dollars.” 

###Supply Chain

The Iranian hackers were discovered in 2018 and had intercepted countless amounts of sensitive data over a 2-year period. The compromised communications included the telecommunication service providers, the internet service providers, government organizations, and others. These attacks were carried out by the manipulation of DNS mechanisms. 

###Operational Technology (OT)

These attacks are the most recent and ongoing attacks that started in late 2019 and are still occurring. Dragos, leading industrial cybersecurity threat intelligence provider, recently reported disruptive targeting OT asset owners. The other targets include oil and gas industry operations and are likely linked to Iranian targets. The main suspected Iranian cyber group is APT33, also known as “Holmium,” “Refined Kitten,” and “Elfin.” The focus of attacks seems to have had a significant shift from IT to OT damage through physical disruption by botnets. The Botnets conduct “password spraying” against manufacturers, supplier, and companies that maintain the systems.

The information regarding these attacks was collected by The Chertoff Group.

##Impact on Cybersecurity Threat Assessment 
With the serious conflict and the threats of retaliation by the Iranian government, it is important that private companies that could be affected by these attacks, heed the warning of the advisories. The known weapons of cyber-attack are the tools previously used such as Wiperware, Ransomware, DDoS, Supply Chain, and OT. Chad Wolf, acting secretary, warned in a Homeland Security advisory, “Iran is capable, at a minimum, of carrying out attacks with temporary disruptive effects against critical infrastructure in the United States.” The FBI also suggested that Infrastructure would be a likely possible target in their advisory. The critical infrastructure to the United States is listed on the CISA site and all private companies working with the following should take precautionary adjustments:

●      Chemical Sector
●      Commercial Facilities Sector
●      Communications Sector
●      Critical Manufacturing Sector
●      Dams Sector
●      Defense Industrial Base Sector
●      Emergency Services Sector
●      Energy Sector
●      Financial Services Sector
●      Food and Agriculture Sector
●      Government Facilities Sector
●      Healthcare and Public Health Sector
●      Information Technology Sector
●      Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector
●      Transportation Systems Sector
●      Water and Wastewater Systems Sector

The CISA published a detailed course of action for the possible affected companies to take action. In the report, there is a helpful list of the publicly known Iranian Advanced Persistent Threats. 

##CISA Recommendations 
The CISA recommendations narrow down to 3 main points: 

●      Adopt a state of heightened awareness. 
●      Increase organizational vigilance. 
●      Exercise organizational incident response plans. 

Furthermore, for IT professionals, the key components of protection are vulnerability mitigation and Incident preparation. This can also be simplified into 5 main points:

●      Disable all unnecessary ports and protocols. 
●      Enhance monitoring of network and email traffic. 
●      Patch externally facing equipment. 
●      Log and limit usage of PowerShell. 
●      Ensure backups are up to date 
All companies and government agencies should closely monitor network traffic, including data flowing, into industrial control systems. In addition, the CISA also told companies to, “Flag any known Iranian indicators of compromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures for immediate response.” 

##What Now? 
The death of Suleimani has severely irritated Iran to the extent of serious cyber threats emerging from the Iranian government. Due to Iran’s self-defense and realization of the country’s security weaknesses, Iran has one of the top military cyber forces and the capacity to inflict substantial damage to the United States, if successful. With Iran’s strong ability to historically attack infrastructure, these threats are to be taken seriously and defensive prevention efforts need to be made. Rohit Kapoor, Vice President of TekMonks, comments, “Cyberwarfare is now almost mainstream between countries, and the casualties are Utilities or large Enterprises who get stuck in the middle.” The most strategic and important task that each possible target could accomplish for the security of our county, is to make precautionary measures to prevent the known methods of attack and mitigate compromised systems. Kapoor’s warns, “strong cyber defense is required, by corporations and government organizations - the hackers are well trained, well-funded and highly motivated.” How will your company act to protect themselves?
