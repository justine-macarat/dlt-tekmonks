DigitalOcean infrastructure is a leading cloud service provider based in the United States of America. Their headquarter operates from New York City, and their data centers are prevalent in every corner of the world in order to provide seamless cloud services across the globe.
In a world full of cloud service providers, the question arises: Why choose DigitalOcean infrastructure? And why not choose any other cloud hosting provider? Here’s why.

Most of the popular cloud service providers overcomplicate things by providing advanced features compromising the user interface, cluttering it with additional features.

It’s user interface is aesthetic, functional, and without all the bells and whistles that complicate things for the new user. The number of links, buttons, and one-click features is optimal to ensure access to the available functionality. However, this doesn’t mean that DigitalOcean lacks functionality.
It is the perfect cloud provider to deploy and manage scalable web applications. Its one-click apps are greatly regarded among individual software developers and small scale organizations as they allow you to enjoy automation and integration with 3rd party tools as well.
Moreover, it provides simple and minimalistic APIs for your convenience. After generating an API, developers can use standard HTTP tools including curl to invoke the API. It also provides SDKS for all the tools which the developers might require while programming in PHP or another language of choice. These tools include various libraries and plugins. It excels in areas such as:

●	Aesthetic and No-Fuss User Interface
●	Remarkable Performance
●	Professional Documentation
●	Affordable Pricing
●	Active Digital Community
