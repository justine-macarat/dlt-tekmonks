#TekMonks Consulting Services - Telecom Vertical
<br/><br/>
##Telecom Technology
<br/>The telecom IT services industry is one of the most dynamic and competitive outsourcing business markets in the world. In the past 10 years, it has grown and evolved tremendously due to dramatic changes in the way people communicate.
<br/>
With changing end-user communication needs, telecom infrastructure providers need to continuously upgrade their communication services. But to deliver such services it's not sufficient to just look at telecom IT service capabilities alone. For instance, succeeding in the 3G business is not only about creating a few Java scripts and succeeding in some middleware but also about providing technical support to the processes and providing technically sound manpower at the backend.
<br/><br/>
