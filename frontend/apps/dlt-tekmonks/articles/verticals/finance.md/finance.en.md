# TekMonks Finance & Insurance Consulting Services

## Technology and Finance
In 2014, more than half of consumer bank interactions around the world took place through online or mobile channels. If we include ATMs and the share of electronic, digital interactions exceeds 85% today and could hit 95% by 2020. Technology is at the heart of this transformation, and with the right capabilities financial firms can compete against nimble, technologically sophisticated start-ups that are reimagining ways to serve customers' financial needs. Executives see the opportunity to deliver differentiated customer experiences and "wow" moments like the ability to deposit checks with a mobile phone camera, remote bill pay or even basic transactions delivered through a good mobile app. And this trend accelerates for younger customers: 39% of those over the age of 45 considered the quality of a mobile app when switching banks, but 58% of those younger than 45 took it into account.
