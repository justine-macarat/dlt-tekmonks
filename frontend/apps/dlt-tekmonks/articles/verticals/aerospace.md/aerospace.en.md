#Successes
TekMonks history is filled with successful projects in the Transportation industry. Some of our sample successes are listed below:
<br/>
* **Infrastructure and Software Services** to Toronto Airport, one of the largest Airports in the world. Dealing with flight critical services.
<br/>
* **One of North America's Largest Aerospace Firms** A large North American aerospace company was having issues with its WebSphere Application Server and DB2 infrastructure. This firm was receiving realtime flight data, from "birds" in the air, via this WebSphere application. So it was a time critical event. When they reached out to IBM for help, IBM recommended TekMonks. We were able to diagnose their issues and resolve their outage within hours. The client recognized our expertise and skills, and handed over the management of their WebSphere and DB2 servers to TekMonks.
